# RHGX Extruder
![RHGX](https://github.com/rOzzy1987/RHGX-extruder/blob/main/Doc/rhgx.png?raw=true)

A simple lightweight extruder using cheap HGX-like gears.
## Introduction
I needed an extruder that is lightweight, fits on a dragon burner toolhead, and has a toolhead PCB mount at the front, so it doesn't have a huge overhang at the back. The inspiration came from the Sherpa Mini, and the ProtoXtruder.

## Footnote
The RHGX Extruder is free to download, print, modify, and it always will be!

If you find it useful, please consider supporting the effort by 2-5$. That way I can spend more time on projects like this.
